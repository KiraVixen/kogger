To expose your external OpenSearch cluster to your existing Kubernetes cluster where Logging Operator is installed, here is a step-by-step approach:
1. Create a Kubernetes Secret for OpenSearch Credentials (if needed)

If your OpenSearch cluster requires authentication, create a Kubernetes secret with the username/password or certificates to use when sending logs:

bash
kubectl create secret generic opensearch-credentials \
  --from-literal=username=admin \
  --from-literal=password=your-password \
  -n your-namespace

2. Define an Output or ClusterOutput resource for Logging Operator

Logging Operator can send logs to external OpenSearch clusters using Output or ClusterOutput custom resources.

Example ClusterOutput targeting your external Opensearch:

text
apiVersion: logging.banzaicloud.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterOutput
metadata:
  name: external-opensearch
spec:
  opensearch:
    host: "<opensearch-url-without-protocol>"
    port: 9200
    scheme: "https"
    tls:
      insecureSkipVerify: true  # If using self-signed certs
    auth:
      username:
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: opensearch-credentials
            key: username
      password:
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: opensearch-credentials
            key: password

Replace placeholders with your cluster name, URL, and credentials.
3. Define a Flow resource to route logs to OpenSearch

Example Flow selecting logs you want to send (pod logs, system logs):

text
apiVersion: logging.banzaicloud.io/v1beta1
kind: Flow
metadata:
  name: send-to-opensearch
  namespace: your-namespace
spec:
  match:
    - selector:
        matchLabels:
          logging: "enabled"  # Example label
  outputRefs:
    - external-opensearch

Adjust the selector or match rules to control what logs are sent.
4. Apply the Configuration

bash
kubectl apply -f opensearch-credentials.yaml
kubectl apply -f clusteroutput.yaml
kubectl apply -f flow.yaml

5. Verify Logs in OpenSearch Dashboard

    Use the OpenSearch Dashboard URL to verify that logs from your cluster are arriving.

    You can use port forwarding or your external URL depending on your setup.

    Try: curl -v https://your-opensearch-url.com:9200

Additional Tips

    Ensure network connectivity from your Kubernetes cluster nodes (or Logging Operator pods) to the external OpenSearch cluster (firewall, VPN, etc.).

    If you use Ingress or LoadBalancer services, ensure proper TLS certificates and DNS resolution.

    Monitor Logging Operator and Fluent Bit/Fluentd pods to ensure log delivery without errors.

This approach allows you to keep OpenSearch external while collecting logs securely and efficiently from your Kubernetes cluster via Logging Operator.

If you want a more specific manifest or commands tailored to your setup, please share your OpenSearch cluster details (cluster name, URLs, namespace).



============================

============================

To expose your existing external OpenSearch cluster to your Kubernetes cluster and collect Calico CNI logs using the installed Banzai Cloud Logging Operator, you need to:

    Create an Output resource for OpenSearch in your cluster that tells the Logging Operator where and how to send logs.

    Create a Flow resource that selects the Calico CNI logs (usually namespace, labels, or container names related to calico-node or CNI) and routes them to the OpenSearch Output.

Suggested new files to create:
1. Output Resource (e.g., opensearch-output.yaml)

text
apiVersion: logging.banzaicloud.io/v1beta1
kind: Output
metadata:
  name: opensearch-output
  namespace: logging  # or the namespace where your logging operator lives
spec:
  opensearch:
    host: <your-opensearch-cluster-hostname>
    port: 9200
    scheme: http  # or https depending on your cluster
    ssl_verify: false  # set true if you have proper TLS certs
    logstash_format: true
    logstash_prefix: calico-cni-logs
    request_timeout: 600s
    buffer:
      timekey: "1m"
      timekey_wait: "10s"
      timekey_use_utc: true
      chunk_limit_size: "2m"
      retry_max_interval: "30"
      retry_forever: true
      overflow_action: "block"

Replace <your-opensearch-cluster-hostname> with your external OpenSearch cluster URL or IP.
2. Flow Resource (e.g., calico-cni-flow.yaml)

text
apiVersion: logging.banzaicloud.io/v1beta1
kind: Flow
metadata:
  name: calico-cni-flow
  namespace: logging  # same namespace as output or where fluentbit agents run
spec:
  filters:
    - grep:
        key: kubernetes.container_name
        regexp: "calico-cni|calico-node" # adjust regex to match your CNI container logs
  match: # Select logs from namespaces or labels where calico cni logs reside
    - select:
        namespaces:
          - kube-system
  localOutputRefs:
    - opensearch-output

Necessary changes to existing CRDs

    No changes strictly needed to your installed CRDs.

    You just create new instances of Output and Flow CRDs as shown above.

    Ensure the namespace of your Logging Operator matches where you apply these resources.

How this works

    The Logging Operator deploys Fluent Bit or Fluentd agents on your nodes as DaemonSets.

    The Flow resource filters logs from the calico cni or node containers (usually in kube-system namespace).

    The Output resource configures where the logs are sent (your external OpenSearch).

    Combined, the logs from /var/log/calico/cni/cni.log collected by agents get forwarded to your OpenSearch cluster for querying via the OpenSearch Dashboard.

Additional tips

    Verify your logging agents have permission to read Calico CNI logs from /var/log/calico/cni/cni.log.

    You may need to add a VolumeMount and PodSecurityPolicy to FluentBit/Fluentd DaemonSet to access those logs if not already done.

    If your OpenSearch cluster requires authentication, add username and password fields to the Output.

    Test connectivity to OpenSearch from within your cluster before applying.
