a drafted Output YAML manifest for your OpenSearch cluster to use with the Logging Operator in Kubernetes:

text
apiVersion: logging.banzaicloud.io/v1beta1
kind: Output
metadata:
  name: opensearch-output
  namespace: logging # Change to your logging namespace if different
spec:
  opensearch:
    host: "<your-opensearch-host>"    # e.g., opensearch-cluster.yourdomain.com
    port: 9200                      # Default OpenSearch HTTP port
    scheme: "https"                 # Use "http" if not TLS
    tls:
      insecureSkipVerify: true      # Set false if you use valid certs
    auth:
      username:
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: opensearch-credentials  # Kubernetes secret containing username
            key: username
      password:
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: opensearch-credentials  # Kubernetes secret containing password
            key: password
    logstashFormat: true             # Use Logstash-style indexing
    logstashPrefix: "kubernetes-logs"  # Prefix for indices created
    requestTimeout: 600s             # Request timeout for OpenSearch requests
    sslVerify: false                 # Whether to verify SSL certs
    buffer:
      timekey: "1m"                 # Time window for buffer files
      timekeyWait: "10s"
      timekeyUseUTC: true
      chunkLimitSize: "2m"
      retryMaxInterval: "30"
      retryForever: true
      overflowAction: "block"

How to use:

    Replace <your-opensearch-host> with your OpenSearch cluster's host URL.

    Create a Kubernetes secret named opensearch-credentials in the same namespace with your OpenSearch username and password.

    Save this YAML as, e.g., opensearch-output.yaml.

    Apply with:

bash
kubectl apply -f opensearch-output.yaml

    Reference this Output in your Logging Operator Flow or ClusterFlow resources to route logs to OpenSearch.


    To reference the OpenSearch Output in your Logging Operator Flow or ClusterFlow resource to route logs, you define the outputRefs field in the Flow spec to point to the output's name.

Here is an example YAML for a Flow that sends logs to the opensearch-output you defined:

text
apiVersion: logging.banzaicloud.io/v1beta1
kind: Flow
metadata:
  name: send-logs-to-opensearch
  namespace: logging   # Namespace where your logs and output reside
spec:
  match:
    - select:
        labels:
          logging: "enabled"   # Example label selector for pods to collect logs from
  filters:
    - parser:
        key_name: message
        parse:
          type: json
        reserve_data: true
    - dedot:
        de_dot_separator: "_"
  outputRefs:
    - opensearch-output   # Reference the Output resource by name

Key points:

    The outputRefs field should match the name of your Output resource (opensearch-output).

    The Flow’s match section specifies which logs to collect (using labels, namespaces, etc.).

    You can add filters to parse or transform the logs before sending.

    Both Flow and Output resources need to be in the same namespace unless you use ClusterFlow/ClusterOutput for cluster-wide scope.

Apply the Flow

Save to file, e.g., opensearch-flow.yaml and apply:

bash
kubectl apply -f opensearch-flow.yaml

Verification

    The Logging Operator will create or update Fluentd/Fluent Bit pods accordingly.

    Monitor logs of those pods for errors.

    Logs matching the Flow criteria will be forwarded to your OpenSearch cluster.

    Check the OpenSearch dashboard for incoming logs.

If needed, I can help draft a ClusterFlow example or adjust the selectors to your use case.

This approach links your logs collection pipeline from Kubernetes pods to your external OpenSearch for centralized monitoring and analysis.

The logs you can expect to see in your external OpenSearch cluster when configured via the Logging Operator to collect Kubernetes logs typically include:
Types of Logs Expected in OpenSearch

    Pod Container Logs

        Standard output and error logs from containers running in your pods.

        Includes application logs, errors, warnings, etc.

    Kubernetes System Component Logs

        Logs from control plane components visible in your cluster.

        e.g., kubelet, scheduler, controller manager, API server logs if collected.

    Node Logs

        Logs related to node-level processes (systemd, kernel logs) if you configure host log collection.

    Network Plugin Logs

        Logs from plugins like Calico (e.g., CNI plugin logs, flow logs) if included in the logging flows.

    Audit Logs

        Kubernetes audit logs capturing API requests, useful for security and compliance.

    Custom Application Logs

        Logs emitted by your own applications deployed in the cluster.

Format and Structure

    Logs are typically stored in JSON format indexed by time-based indices (e.g., kubernetes-logs-YYYY.MM.DD).

    Common fields include metadata like namespace, pod_name, container_name, log, timestamp, labels, and cluster info.

    This structure allows powerful searching, filtering, and dashboarding in OpenSearch Dashboards.

Summary
Log Type	Description
Pod Logs	stdout/stderr from containerized apps
System Component Logs	kubelet, scheduler, etc.
Node Logs	Node OS and system logs
Network Plugin Logs	Calico or other CNI plugin logs
Audit Logs	API access and modification tracking
Application Logs	Custom logs from deployed applications

If you specifically configured Flows to collect Calico or other logs, you'll see those in OpenSearch. Also, your Logging Operator configuration determines precisely which logs get forwarded.

You can verify the ingested logs by exploring the OpenSearch Dashboards and searching indexes created with your configured logstashPrefix or index name.




To show your cni.log (or any Calico CNI logs) in OpenSearch, you need to ensure that your Logging Operator pipeline collects those logs from the file location on your nodes or pods and forwards them to OpenSearch.

Here’s how you can do that:
1. Create a Flow resource to collect cni.log

Since cni.log resides on nodes (for example, /var/log/calico/cni/cni.log), you need to configure Fluent Bit or Fluentd (managed by Logging Operator) to tail this file.

Example of a Flow with a Host Tailer input for the CNI log file:

text
apiVersion: logging.banzaicloud.io/v1beta1
kind: Flow
metadata:
  name: calico-cni-log-flow
  namespace: logging
spec:
  match:
    - select:
        labels:
          # You can match pods or nodes depending on your setup
          app: calico-node
  filters:
    - dedot:
        de_dot_separator: _
  stdout: false
  localOutputRefs:
    - opensearch-output  # Reference to your OpenSearch Output
  # Define an input specifically for host file tailing if needed
  input:
    hostTailer:
      files:
        - path: "/var/log/calico/cni/cni.log"
          multiline:
            delimiter: ""
            flush_timeout: 5s

2. Make sure your logging agent has permissions

    The Fluent Bit or Fluentd pods must run with permissions to access the node's /var/log/calico/cni/cni.log (typically via a hostPath mount).

    The Logging Operator deploys agents as DaemonSets running on every node, so they can be configured to tail host logs.

Example volume mount for host logs in DaemonSet spec (usually configured by the operator):

text
volumes:
  - name: varlog
    hostPath:
      path: /var/log
      type: Directory
containers:
  - name: fluent-bit
    volumeMounts:
      - name: varlog
        mountPath: /var/log

3. Apply your updated Flow resource

bash
kubectl apply -f calico-cni-log-flow.yaml

4. Verify logs in OpenSearch Dashboards

    Check OpenSearch for indexed documents with your log prefix or index.

    Search for keywords from cni.log entries.

    Use OpenSearch Dashboard filters and queries to analyze these logs.

Summary
Step	Description
Create Flow with hostTailer	Define hostTailer input for /var/log/calico/cni/cni.log
Ensure permissions	DaemonSet volumes must mount /var/log on nodes
Route Flow to Output	Reference your OpenSearch Output in Flow resource
Apply and Monitor	Deploy Flow resource, observe logs in OpenSearch

This setup enables your queryable Calico CNI logs inside OpenSearch for monitoring and security analysis.

If needed, I can help draft the full DaemonSet updates or HostTailer volume mounts.To show your Calico cni.log in OpenSearch, configure your Logging Operator with a Flow resource that tails the /var/log/calico/cni/cni.log file on each node and sends it to your OpenSearch Output.

Example Flow:

text
apiVersion: logging.banzaicloud.io/v1beta1
kind: Flow
metadata:
  name: calico-cni-log-flow
  namespace: logging
spec:
  match:
    - select:
        labels:
          app: calico-node
  filters:
    - dedot:
        de_dot_separator: _
  localOutputRefs:
    - opensearch-output   # Your OpenSearch Output reference
  input:
    hostTailer:
      files:
        - path: "/var/log/calico/cni/cni.log"
          multiline:
            delimiter: ""
            flush_timeout: 5s

Make sure your Fluent Bit/Fluentd pods run with permissions to access /var/log on the host (mounted via hostPath).

Apply this Flow, and your CNI logs will start appearing in OpenSearch for analysis via OpenSearch Dashboards.
